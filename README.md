Sales data analysis and dashboard using Excel and Microsoft Power BI.

ðŸ§© Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard visualizes revenue-related metrics from a multinational supermarket sales dataset across multiple dimensions: time, location, product line, sales method, and urgency status. The goal of this project is to uncover revenue patterns and business opportunities based on product performance and regional contributions.

ðŸ§© Key Contributions
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Applied comprehensive data cleaning using Power Query Editor in Power BI:
- Removed unnecessary and duplicate columns
- Promoted headers and standardized column names
- Trimmed, cleaned, and replaced inconsistent values
- Changed data types for accuracy (e.g., Date, Number)
- Used Fill Down and Split Column by for structured transformation
2. Data Modeling
I built a simple relational data model by linking Product Code in the Sales Table to the Product Table, and RefCity in the Sales Table to City in the Country Table.
3. DAX Measures
I created custom calculated columns and measures using DAX, including Revenue, COGS, Profit, Margin %, Sale Category, and Status.
4. Interactive Visualizations
Designed a multi-page dashboard:
- Revenue Report â€“ by product, channel, region, and urgency
- Profit Analysis â€“ trend and breakdown by product and method
- COGS Report â€“ cost insights across categories and time
